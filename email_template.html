      CEASE AND DESIST ORDER
    </h3>
    <h4>
      Dear {bad_guy_name}:
    </h4>
    <p>
      This CEASE AND DESIST ORDER is to inform you that your persistent actions
      including but not limited to emailing, calling or texting, and etc have
      become unbearable. You are ORDERED TO STOP such activities immediately as
      they are being done in violation of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have the right to remain free from these activities as they constitute
      spamming or harassment, and I will pursue any legal remedies available to
      me against you if these activities continue. These remedies include but
      are not limited to: contacting law enforcement to obtain criminal
      sanctions against you, and suing you civilly for damages I have incurred
      as a result of your actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, you must IMMEDIATELY STOP those activities and send me written
      confirmation that you will stop such activities. You risk incurring some
      very severe legal consequences if you fail to comply with this demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter acts as your final warning to discontinue this unwanted
      conduct before I pursue legal actions against you. At this time, I am not
      contacting the authorities or filing civil suit against you, as I hope we
      can resolve this matter without authoritative involvement. I am not under
      any circumstances, however, waiving any legal rights I have presently, or
      future legal remedies against you by sending you this letter. This order
      acts as ONE FINAL CHANCE for you to cease your illegal activities before I
      exercise my rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ensure compliance with this letter, and to halt any legal action I may
      take against you, I require you to fill in and sign the attached form and
      mail it back to me within 10 days of your receipt of this letter. Failure
      to do so will act as evidence of your infringement upon my legal rights,
      and I will immediately seek legal avenues to remedy the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      {my_name}
    </p>
